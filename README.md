# Verified DIR-24-8 LPM data structure

Formally verified DIR-24-8 Longest Prefix Match data structure. Done in the context of my bachelor project at [DSLAB](https://dslab.epfl.ch/), EPFL.

The static analysis tool used for verification is a [modified version of VeriFast](https://github.com/vigor-nf/verifast) along with Z3 Theorem Prover.

The data structure has been added to the [Vigor](https://github.com/vigor-nf/vigor) project library.

This repo only contains the code I produced for my bachelor project and won't compile or verify as is, you'll need to use it in the context of the [Vigor](https://github.com/vigor-nf/vigor) project.
